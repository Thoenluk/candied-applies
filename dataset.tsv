Cloth	Embersilk Cloth	#FFC687													
			Bolt of Embersilk Cloth												
				Crafted	Bolt of Embersilk Cloth	~	~	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	5 Embersilk Cloth per Bolt			Cloth, Embersilk Cloth
			Dreamcloth												
				Crafted	Dream of non-Destruction	~	~	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Each pattern has a 7 day cooldown, requires 30 of one Volatile element, and produces one Dreamcloth.			Cloth, Bolt of Embersilk Cloth; Elemental, Volatile Air; Elemental, Volatile Earth; Elemental, Volatile Fire; Elemental, Volatile Life; Elemental, Volatile Water
			Embersilk Cloth												
				Drop	Virtually any humanoid / undead in Cataclysm zones	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Pick any target you can comfortably kill and go to town. Highly skilled Tailors can learn to scavenge significantly more cloth when they loot a monster.			
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else by kills.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
Elemental	Volatile Fire	#FF0000													
			Volatile Air												
				Drop	Vortex Pinnacle trash		Vortex Pinnacle	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	A little bonus during regular runs, but also farmable on normal. To farm Air, clear trash up to Altairus (you may also kill the dragon for a chance at the mount, even on normal) and hop off the edge to go safely back to the entrance, then go out and reset.			
				Drop	Hive Queen's Honeycomb		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by the Florawing Hive Queen at the base of the waterfall in the instance's northwest corner. Immediately turn left at the entrance as if heading to Zanzil. She drops one Honeycomb for the group to share, but can be soloed with some effort by some classes. It contains 4-6 each of Twilight Jasmine, Volatile Air, and Volatile Life. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed, however the Honeycomb was made a secret daily reward at some point and may still be so.			
				Drop	Enslaved Tempest		Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	They are high level and spread around an endgame cultist camp, but have decent drop rates of Volatile Air at 0.28 per kill. This is the best you get outside of dungeons.			
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Drop	Sweeping Winds		Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	While they were patched in during 4.0.3 as a farmable source of Volatile Air, they still only drop 0.18 Air per kill and are actually slightly tougher than Scions of Al'Akir. Combined, the two make an okay farming spot with no irrelevant mobs around.			Elemental, Volatile Air, Scion of Al'Akir
				Drop	Scion of Al'Akir		Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	4	This mob and by extension all the Volatile Air farms being terrible is actually the reason this guide exists. I once thought they were the only open world mob to drop Air. While not true, it's not much better. These guys drop 0.18 Air per kill and require six kills for a mandatory quest. Probably best combined with the Sweeping Winds around them.			Elemental, Volatile Air, Sweeping Winds
				Drop	Storm Vortex		Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Plausible Hyperspawn. Higher level than Howling Riftdwellers and have slightly better drop rate at 0.18 Air per kill, but high level, also mixed with cultists, and quest-relevant.			
				Drop	Howling Riftdweller		Mount Hyjal	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Plausible Hyperspawn. Drop rate for Air is very bad at approximately 0.135 Air per kill, they are spread along the ridge alongside cultists, and they must be killed for a quest (though there are many more than needed for the quest.)			
				Crafted	Transmute: Living Elements		Transmutation with CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Transmutes 15 Volatile Life into 14-16 of a "random" element. The element choice can be forced by being in a specific zone: Vashj'ir for Water, Mount Hyjal for Fire, Deepholm for Earth, and Uldum for Air. Alchemists specialised in Transmutation may receive extra Volatiles, which are always random. Shares cooldown with transmuting Pyrite and Truegold, so make sure to research how to best use your daily cooldown.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Drop	Electrostatic Condenser	~	Any	Engineering	FALSE	Phase 1	0	If you have a Condenser in your inventory with good Engineering skill, you gain around a 2% chance to get 1-2 Volatile Air as an additional drop whenever you mine, skin, or herb something. While it's free stuff, it's incredibly marginal and requires you to be an engineer and gatherer. If you are, go craft one, but don't pick up Engineering on all your alts just for this.			Metal; Herb; Leather
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Volatile Earth												
				Drop	Tor-Tun		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Reportedly, Tor-Tun can be struck by frost cauldrons multiple times, making them simple to kill or even solo. They drop an average of 6 Earth, but you should bring a skinner if possible as they have very valuable skin. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed.			
				Mined	Any ore deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Simply mining deposits has a very high chance of getting Volatiles. Rich Obsidium Deposits drop more Earth, but any vein is good.			Metal
				Drop	Obsidium Punisher		Molten Front	~	FALSE	Phase 3	1	They are not directly relevant for any quest and are usually seen as more of an annoyance while questing. Requires that you have unlocked the Molten Front, but features a decent 0.28 Earth per kill, 0.25 Earth when mined, and a chance of Elementium Ore.			
				Prospected	Pyrite Ore		~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Probably not why you are prospecting it, but a handy bonus of an average of 2 Earth per prospect.			
				Mined	Any minable NPC		Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Almost every mob that can be mined for Earth is located in Deepholm. See Drop sources for notable mobs that also drop it.			
				Drop	Scalding Rock Elemental		Mount Hyjal	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Extremely plentiful and right next to the portal exit. This makes up for their terrible drop rate of 0.15 Earth per kill and mining for a slight chance of one more, but you'll also have to contend with other farmers and jewelcrafters trying to complete their dailies.			
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Drop	Obsidian Stoneslave		Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Around 0.2 Earth per kill plus being minable for another 0.2 and a slight chance of Elementium Ore. Decent drops, but quest-relevant and their rupture line ability deals a lot of damage if you are not paying attention.			
				Drop	Lava Surger		Mount Hyjal	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Only 0.15 Earth per kill, but can be mined for a slight chance of more. Not visible if you complete the quests in their area.			
				Drop	Molten Tormentor		Mount Hyjal	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Hidden in an unmountable cave, quest relevant, and cannot be mined for extra drops, while also dropping only around 0.15 Earth per kill.			
				Crafted	Transmute: Living Elements		Transmutation with CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Transmutes 15 Volatile Life into 14-16 of a "random" element. The element choice can be forced by being in a specific zone: Vashj'ir for Water, Mount Hyjal for Fire, Deepholm for Earth, and Uldum for Air. Alchemists specialised in Transmutation may receive extra Volatiles, which are always random. Shares cooldown with transmuting Pyrite and Truegold, so make sure to research how to best use your daily cooldown.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Volatile Fire												
				Drop	Enslaved Inferno		Twilight Highlands		FALSE	Phase 1	2	Cultists are annoying, but their drop rate of 0.28 Fire per kill is the highest other than Magma Giants and Molten Front mobs and you can fish Pools of Fire in the same area. If you can kill them decently well, this is the best farm before phase 3.			Elemental, Volatile Fire, Pool of Fire: Twilight Highlands
				Drop	Molten Front fire elementals		Molten Front	Quest	FALSE	Phase 3	1	Some mobs added in phase 2 that drop Fire are in Mount Hyjal, but all of them are level 85 and drop 0.28 Fire per kill. In order, you want to look at Charred Vanquishers (best by far, easy to farm), Flame Terrors, Brimstone Destroyers, Flamewatch Sentinels, Charred Invaders, and Seething Pyrelords. Some require questing to be visible, some require that you can enter the Molten Front.			
				Drop	Magma Giant		Mount Hyjal	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	1	While elite, they can be slowed and CCed, allowing many classes to take them out solo. They drop an average of 0.3 Fire per kill, which isn't a lot, but can be woven in between fishing Pools of Fire.			Elemental, Volatile Fire, Pool of Fire: Mount Hyjal
				Drop	Twilight Highlands fire elementals		Twilight Highlands		FALSE	Phase 1	2	Not including Enslaved Infernos, which are a better source by drop rate, all of these elementals drop an average of 0.18 Fire per kill. Magmalord Falthazar, Unbound Emberfiend, and Bound Fleshburner are located in the Twilight camp northwest of Thundermar. Subjugated Firestarters are near Firebeard's Patrol, but do NOT drop any loot!			
				Drop	Mount Hyjal fire elementals		Mount Hyjal		FALSE	Phase 1	2	For all of these, you can distinguish them by being added in phase 1 and not being level 85. Their drop rate for Fire is frankly terrible at 0.15 Fire per kill. The only difference between them is other mobs being present. In order, I'd look at Blazebound Elementals, Searing Guardians, Raging Firestorms, Flame Ascendants, Fiery Tormentors, Fiery Instructors, and Unbound Fire Elementals.			
				Fished	Pool of Fire: Mount Hyjal		Mount Hyjal	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Can only be fished from Pools of Fire. Two will spawn at a time and emptying one should cause another to spawn quickly until all 4 spawn points have been emptied, at which point the respawn timer must be waited out. Reports vary between exactly 15 minutes to respawn down to 5-10.			
				Fished	Pool of Fire: Twilight Highlands		Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Can only be fished from Pools of Fire. Two will spawn at a time and emptying one should cause another to spawn quickly until all 4 spawn points have been emptied, at which point the respawn timer must be waited out. Reports vary between exactly 15 minutes to respawn down to 5-10.			
				Mined	Elementium Deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	0.15 Fire per vein, while Riches give 0.25. Not a good concentrated source, but a lovely bonus on top.			Metal, Elementium Ore
				Mined	Pyrite Deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	0.15 Fire per deposit, while Riches give 0.25. Not a good concentrated source, but a lovely bonus on top.			Metal, Pyrite Ore
				Crafted	Transmute: Living Elements		Transmutation with CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Transmutes 15 Volatile Life into 14-16 of a "random" element. The element choice can be forced by being in a specific zone: Vashj'ir for Water, Mount Hyjal for Fire, Deepholm for Earth, and Uldum for Air. Alchemists specialised in Transmutation may receive extra Volatiles, which are always random. Shares cooldown with transmuting Pyrite and Truegold, so make sure to research how to best use your daily cooldown.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Volatile Life												
				Gathered	Any herb	~	Any	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Like with Earth and miners, the best source of these are herbalists. They just passively generate them. All herbs drop an average of 1 Volatile Life when gathered.			Herb
				Drop	Hive Queen's Honeycomb		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by the Florawing Hive Queen at the base of the waterfall in the instance's northwest corner. Immediately turn left at the entrance as if heading to Zanzil. She drops one Honeycomb for the group to share, but can be soloed with some effort by some classes. It contains 4-6 each of Twilight Jasmine, Volatile Air, and Volatile Life. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed, however the Honeycomb was made a secret daily reward at some point and may still be so.			
				Gathered	Fungal Behemoth		Deepholm	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Drops 0.15 Life when gathered after being looted.			
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Volatile Water												
				Drop	Enslaved Waterspout		Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Plausible Hyperspawn. They are quest-relevant and very underwater, but that should not be a problem. When killed, they express their gratitude which makes it hard to loot them, but waiting a few seconds (while killing another) will make their 0.3 Water easily lootable.			
				Drop	Muddied Water Elemental		Twilight Highlands		FALSE	Phase 1	1	Plausible Hyperspawn. Quest-relevant to both factions, but on dry land. Drop 0.18 Volatile Water each and are very easy to kill.			
				Drop	Compelled Elemental		Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths		FALSE	Phase 1	1	Found inside the big snail. At 0.15 Water per kill, cultists around, and a bad population, while also being very out of the way, they are not a great farm but a good place for when you don't want to talk to anyone.			
				Fished	Any school of fish	~	Any	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Odds are not great, but they are a lovely bonus when acquiring fish, unless the fish are worth more than Volatile Water since Volatiles count as a catch for depleting the school.			Meat
				Mined	Elementium Deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	0.15 Water per vein, while Riches give 0.25. Not a good concentrated source, but a lovely bonus on top.			Metal, Elementium Ore
				Crafted	Transmute: Living Elements		Transmutation with CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Transmutes 15 Volatile Life into 14-16 of a "random" element. The element choice can be forced by being in a specific zone: Vashj'ir for Water, Mount Hyjal for Fire, Deepholm for Earth, and Uldum for Air. Alchemists specialised in Transmutation may receive extra Volatiles, which are always random. Shares cooldown with transmuting Pyrite and Truegold, so make sure to research how to best use your daily cooldown.			
				Drop	Water-Filled Gills		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Lost Offspring of Gahz'ranka in the waters surrounding the central temple. The Gills contain an average of 19 Volatile Water, however the drop chance for the Gills is only 1.2% to begin with. This gives the Offspring an expected 0.23 Water per kill. They are, however, much less practical to farm without a group and 98.8% of the time you'll get nothing at all.			
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
				Fished	Any water	~	Any	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	While you can get Volatiles fishing in open water, the drop rate is so low that selling whatever else you fish up will buy you many more Volatiles than you get directly.			
Enchanting	Enchanting	#9900ff													
			Greater Celestial Essence												
				Created	Lesser Celestial Essence	~	Enchanting	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	3 into 1 just like all essences. Anyone can do this.			Enchanting, Lesser Cosmic Essence
				Disenchanted	High level Cataclysm greens	~	Enchanting	Enchanting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Green items with item level 306-315 (Requires level 83 or 84) will drop 1-2 Greater Essences, while 316-333 (the Redsteel set or items requiring level 85) will drop 2-3. Weapons have a 75% chance to drop Essences while armour has 25%. See table, data credit to Goodwinn on Wowhead.			
				Crafted	Maelstrom Shatter	~	~	Enchanting	FALSE	Phase 4	0	Converts one Maelstrom Crystal into two Greater Heavenly Shards.			Enchanting, Abyss Crystal
			Heavenly Shard												
				Disenchanted	High level Cataclysm blues	~	Enchanting	Enchanting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Blue items with item level 318-377 will drop exactly one Heavenly Shard always. See table, data credit to Goodwinn on Wowhead.			
				Crafted	Small Heavenly Shard	~	Enchanting	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	3 into 1. Unlike earlier iterations, this can be done freely by anyone, but you cannot reverse the process even with Enchanting, because Small Heavenly Shards serve literally no purpose other than making regular shards.			
			Hypnotic Dust												
				Disenchanted	Any Wrath green	~	Enchanting	Enchanting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Green items with item level 272-333 drop increasing amounts of Dust, with armour having a 75% chance to drop it and weapons 25%. The expected amount of dust increases by 0.5 for each item level tier, starting at 1.5 for 272-277 and increasing to 3.5 at 319-333. See table, data credit to Goodwinn on Wowhead.			
			Lesser Celestial Essence												
				Disenchanted	Low level Cataclysm greens	~	Enchanting	Enchanting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Green items with item level 272-305 (Requires level 77-82) will drop Lesser Celestial Essences. Weapons have a higher chance to drop Essences than armour, but both will drop the same amounts at a given item level. See table, data credit to Goodwinn on Wowhead.			
				Created	Greater Cosmic Essence	~	Enchanting	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	1 into 3 just like all essences. Anyone can do this.			Enchanting, Greater Cosmic Essence
			Maelstrom Crystal												
				Disenchanted	Any Cataclysm epic	~	Enchanting	Enchanting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Unlike prior iterations, it seems Maelstrom Crystals will never be disenchanted from blue items. Each item disenchants into exactly 1 Crystal.			
				Drop	Mortaxx		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Drops exactly one Maelstrom Crystal for the group to share when killed. Can be found on the northeastern edge of the instance, either turning left at the entrance and travelling east along the path or going straight until one passes the Cache of Madness. Killing Mortaxx does not save you to the instance, but reaching him is quite a lot of effort compared to the other minibosses.			
			Small Heavenly Shard												
				Disenchanted	Low level Cataclysm blues	~	Enchanting	Enchanting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Blue items with item level 288-316 (requires level 78-81) will drop exactly one Small Heavenly Shard. See table, data credit to Goodwinn on Wowhead.			
Herb	Herbalism	#6aa84f													
			Azshara's Veil												
				Gathered	Tol Barad Peninsula		Tol Barad Peninsula	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Grows along the river and the northern reef on the Peninsula, the northern contested area. Navigating the water in the ravine is a bit annoying if you don't have ways to mitigate swimming, but back in the day no one knew these even grew here.			
				Gathered	Vashj'ir		Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths	Herbalism, Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Don't worry, you can get underwater breathing and your seahorse mount in like three quests. This is where Azshara's Veil is definitely the most abundant, and most spawns are in open and accessible places, requiring no further questing.			
				Gathered	Mount Hyjal		Mount Hyjal	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Only grows in a few of Hyjal's very select bodies of water that are not lava. Given Hyjal is by far the more popular zone, it cannot be recommended if you are looking for Veils.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
				Fished	Open water		Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	They are a nice additional catch on the Peninsula, the northern contested area, but at a 5% chance for an average of 1.5 odds are not great. There are also recorded catches in Uldum and the Twilight Highlands, but at terrible odds.			
				Container	Satchel of Freshly-Picked Herbs	~	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Contains a total of 20 random assorted herbs. While technically a way to acquire them without herbalism, please use your Justice on anything else. It's very rare that only 20 plants are the best thing it can buy.			
			Cinderbloom												
				Gathered	Mount Hyjal		Mount Hyjal	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	3	While Hyjal is the obvious place to go for Cinderbloom, it is so for a reason. You will find almost nothing else there and there is a lot of it in a relatively small, low-level zone. Cinderbloom prefers grassless areas and seems to like sheer terrain, making it much easier if you have flying.			
				Gathered	Tol Barad		Tol Barad Peninsula; Tol Barad	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Unlike Azshara's Veil, Cinderbloom grows in both parts of Tol Barad. It can be good to pick up alongside Veils. Cinderbloom prefers grassless areas and seems to like sheer terrain, making it much easier if you have flying.			
				Gathered	Deepholm		Deepholm	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Outside of Hyjal, your choice is primarily what you want to pick alongside Cinderbloom. Deepholm is probably the best for Cinderbloom itself and also yields Heartbloom. Cinderbloom prefers grassless areas and seems to like sheer terrain, making it much easier if you have flying.			
				Gathered	Twilight Highlands		Twilight Highlands	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Outside of Hyjal, your choice is primarily what you want to pick alongside Cinderbloom. The Twilight Highlands features the valuable Twilight Jasmine and other farmers may focus only on Jasmines, leaving Cinderbloom for you to grab. Cinderbloom prefers grassless areas and seems to like sheer terrain, making it much easier if you have flying.			
				Gathered	Uldum		Uldum	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Outside of Hyjal, your choice is primarily what you want to pick alongside Cinderbloom. Uldum has Whiptail, but only along the water. You may be doing everyone a favour by picking Cinderbloom nodes that may be blocking Whiptail spawns. Cinderbloom prefers grassless areas and seems to like sheer terrain, making it much easier if you have flying.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
				Container	Satchel of Freshly-Picked Herbs	~	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Contains a total of 20 random assorted herbs. While technically a way to acquire them without herbalism, please use your Justice on anything else. It's very rare that only 20 plants are the best thing it can buy.			
			Heartblossom												
				Gathered	Deepholm		Deepholm	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	4	The bad news is Heartblossom only grows in Deepholm. The good news is that it's absolutely everywhere except Therazane's Throne. (She stomps them because she's nasty and ugly and hates flowers.) As per old Wowhead comments, there may be some areas of quest phasing that Heartblossom can spawn and become trapped in. So if you progress a quest and find many nodes suddenly, you may be well off not to do anything more for that quest.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.

			Stormvine												
				Gathered	Vashj'ir		Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths	Herbalism, Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Stormvine very noticeably fills out the spaces Azshara's Veil doesn't grow, making for a nice and balanced breakfast. You'll probably have the best time farming in the Shimmering Expanse, but anywhere is fine. Hunters on the lookout for a certain ghostly crawler can gather some Stormvine while they hunt. Stormvine, being a vine, grows near other plants.			
				Gathered	Mount Hyjal		Mount Hyjal	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	3	The spawn points in Hyjal are not exactly plentiful and may require some quest progress to switch from Cinderbloom to Stormvine. Stormvine, being a vine, grows near other plants.

			Twilight Jasmine												
				Drop	Hive Queen's Honeycomb		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by the Florawing Hive Queen at the base of the waterfall in the instance's northwest corner. Immediately turn left at the entrance as if heading to Zanzil. She drops one Honeycomb for the group to share, but can be soloed with some effort by some classes. It contains 4-6 each of Twilight Jasmine, Volatile Air, and Volatile Life. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed, however the Honeycomb was made a secret daily reward at some point and may still be so.			
				Gathered	Twilight Highlands		Twilight Highlands	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	5	The bad news is that Twilight Jasmine only grows in the Twilight Highlands. There is no good news. There are plenty of nodes, but its supply does not meet the demand this useful little plant will have. I would strongly advise looking into other farms and simply buying what you need, or the Hive Queen's Honeycomb if Zul'Gurub is available. Twilight Jasmine likes to grow in grassy plains, where Cinderbloom is not.			Herb, Twilight Jasmine, Hive Queen's Honeycomb

			Whiptail												
				Gathered	Tol Barad		Tol Barad	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Only grows in the marsh on the isle of Tol Barad proper, the battleground. This is a high density area sure to have competition (from the other faction too, if such a thing still exists for you) but it's just great farming, so it may be worthwhile. Whiptail only grows on the bank of water.			
				Gathered	Uldum		Uldum	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	3	The bad news is that Whiptail only grows in Uldum. The good news is that spawns are somewhat plentiful and concentrated in easy to farm locations, that being Uldum's only river. According to ancient comments, it also spawns in the dried Cradle of the Ancients, but only BEFORE you complete Put the Baby in the Cradle and fill the area with water. You may want to avoid doing so and keep access to these spawns.

There are three dailies to cut 3 Jaspers, Zephyrites, or Nightstones, for which you must cut them yourself while on the quest and perfects don't count; One daily to beat up elementals for 10 goo (doable in Hyjal, but being level 80 makes it much simpler to teleport there); And one daily to apply a provided item to any 10 humanoids. 	67.2, 30.9

				Mined	Ozruk			Mining, Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Ozruk can be mined for 1-2 uncommon gems, should you manage to kill the unkillable.			
				Container	Crystalline Geode			Group	FALSE	Phase 4	0	Killing one of the first seven bosses in Dragonsoul on either difficulty will award everyone in the raid with a Mote of Darkness whose only use is buying Crystalline Geodes. Their content is not amazing, but hey, free gems.			
				Mined	Any Cataclysm ore node			Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Odds are very bad around 0.8% per node, just an occasional bonus on top of ore.			Metal, Obsidium Ore; Metal, Elementium Ore; Metal, Pyrite Ore
			Ocean Sapphire												
				Crafted	Transmute: Ocean Sapphire	~	Transmutation without CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	This transmute has NO cooldown, the materials are very reasonable, you get 20% extra product if specialised, and it is even part of the alchemy levelling path so you may find alchemists glad to do this for you. It's just a simple and clean way to get gems.			
				Prospected	Obsidium Ore, Elementium Ore, Pyrite Ore	~	Prospecting	Jewelcrafting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	See table for drop chances. Note the percentages are for finding one or two of a particular gem. You will always find something and sometimes find two gems of some rarities.			Metal, Obsidium Ore; Metal, Elementium Ore; Metal, Pyrite Ore
				Container	Crystalline Geode			Group	FALSE	Phase 4	0	Killing one of the first seven bosses in Dragonsoul on either difficulty will award everyone in the raid with a Mote of Darkness whose only use is buying Crystalline Geodes. Their content is not amazing, but hey, free gems.			
				Container	Satchel of Exotic Mysteries	~	~	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	These baggies were originally handed out for queueing up to random heroics with a role that was highly in demand in the dungeon finder. It is unclear at time of writing whether they will be available and how so. It is likely that you can acquire them, but only by being a tank and possibly a healer, as per Northrend Adventuring Supplies. They have a 5% chance to contain any one rare gem (30% total).			
				Quest	Myzerian's Head			Group, Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Once you have progressed Uldum enough to blow up the Obelisk of the Moon (which is quite far in the zone), Myzerian becomes wounded and killable. He is still no easy fight, but his head can be turned in for a one-time reward of one Amberjewel, Inferno Ruby, and Ocean Sapphire.			
				Crafted	Fire Prism	~	~	Jewelcrafting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	20 hour cooldown. Requires three of each uncommon gem. Contains 2.6 rare gems of random colours, plus a 10% chance for a Chimera's Eye. Does not and never will contain epic gems. Very carefully research whether it is worth crafting this. Uncommon gems are widely used for levelling jewelcrafting and alchemy as well as jewelcrafting dailies. Speaking of alchemy, any alchemist can turn the same uncommon gems plus a few herbs into a guaranteed 6 rare gems, with 20% extra product if they are specialised in transmutation.

				Mined	Any Cataclysm ore node			Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Odds are hilariously bad around 0.16% per node, just an occasional bonus on top of ore.			Metal, Obsidium Ore; Metal, Elementium Ore; Metal, Pyrite Ore
			Queen's Garnet												
				Container	Elementium-Coated Geode	~	~	Group	FALSE	Phase 4	0	Killing the Madness of Deathwing on normal or heroic will award everyone in the raid with an Essence of Corrupted Deathwing whose only use is buying an Elementium-Coated Geode. It will always contain exactly one of Lava Coral, Queen's Garnet, or Shadow Spinel.			
				Container	Crystalline Geode			Group	FALSE	Phase 4	0	Killing one of the first seven bosses in Dragonsoul on either difficulty will award everyone in the raid with a Mote of Darkness whose only use is buying Crystalline Geodes. Their content is not amazing, but hey, free gems.			
			Shadow Spinel												
				Container	Elementium-Coated Geode	~	~	Group	FALSE	Phase 4	0	Killing the Madness of Deathwing on normal or heroic will award everyone in the raid with an Essence of Corrupted Deathwing whose only use is buying an Elementium-Coated Geode. It will always contain exactly one of Lava Coral, Queen's Garnet, or Shadow Spinel.			
				Container	Crystalline Geode			Group	FALSE	Phase 4	0	Killing one of the first seven bosses in Dragonsoul on either difficulty will award everyone in the raid with a Mote of Darkness whose only use is buying Crystalline Geodes. Their content is not amazing, but hey, free gems.			
			Shadowspirit Diamond												
				Container	Any clam	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	This transmute has NO cooldown and produces 2 Diamonds per craft. Alchemists specialised in transmutation produce 20% extra product. The materials kinda suck given the gems can also be transmuted into rare gems or used in jewelcrafting dailies, but since this is the ONLY source of Shadowspirit Diamonds, what else will you do.			Jewelcrafting, Alicite; Jewelcrafting, Carnelian; Jewelcrafting, Hessonite; Jewelcrafting, Jasper; Jewelcrafting, Nightstone; Jewelcrafting, Zephyrite
			Zephyrite												
				Drop	Giant Sack		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Mor'Lek the Dismantler and Kaulema the Mover, respectively in front of the stairs above the Coil (where you used to hand in enchantments) and two right turns uphill from Mor'Lek, this bag contains an average of 11.4 Elementium Ore and two of either Nightstone, Jasper, or Zephyrite. It can be obtained from each of the two trolls per instance. If you don't kill an actual boss, even though Zul'Gurub requires Heroic difficulty, you can simply reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Prospected	Obsidium Ore, Elementium Ore, Pyrite Ore	~	Prospecting	Jewelcrafting	FALSE	Phase 1	0	See table for drop chances. Note the percentages are for finding one or two of a particular gem. You will always find something and sometimes find two gems of some rarities.			Metal, Obsidium Ore; Metal, Elementium Ore; Metal, Pyrite Ore

Leather	Savage Leather	#b45f06													
			Blackened Dragonscale												
				Skinned	Cataclysm dragons	~	~	Skinning	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Odds to skin one or more scales go up the higher the dragonkin is in level and if it is elite. However, unless you are already running a dungeon and picking the scraps, you are likely better off farming regular dragons out in the open world.			
			Deepsea Scale												
				Drop	Tor-Tun		Zul'Gurub	Skinning, Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Reportedly, Tor-Tun can be struck by frost cauldrons multiple times, making them simple to kill or even solo. They drop an average of 6 Earth, but you should bring a skinner if possible as they have very valuable skin. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed.			
				Skinned	King Crawler	~	Feralas	Skinning	TRUE	Phase 1	2	Despite being in Feralas, the crawlers are level 83 or 84. They are clustered together and simple to kill where most other mobs dropping Deepsea Scales are underwater. They even have one of the highest drop rates for Deepsea Scales, which is interesting because crabs don't have scales.			
				Skinned	Any wet Cataclysm mob	~	Any	Skinning	FALSE	Phase 1	1	The best zone for Deepsea Scales is without a doubt Vashj'ir, where there are the most fishies and you can most easily move between them. If a mob is located in or around water and can be skinned, it will probably drop them.			
			Heavy Savage Leather												
				Crafted	Heavy Savage Leather	~	~	Leatherworking	FALSE	Phase 1	0	5 regular Leather create one Heavy.			Leather, Savage Leather
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Pristine Hide												
				Sold	Leatherworking Suppliers	~	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Sold at 10 Heavy Savage Leather each, meaning 50 regular Savage Leather, this is the simple and quick way to get any Hides you need.			
				Skinned	Any Cataclysm mob	~	~	Skinning	FALSE	Phase 1	1	While any mob theoretically may have been observed to once drop a Pristine Hide, you can easily skin a thousand mobs and never see one. It can be skinned, but if you are looking for Pristine Hides, you would be better off trading the leather you get.			Leather, Pristine Hide, Leatherworking Suppliers
			Savage Leather												
				Drop	Tor-Tun		Zul'Gurub	Skinning, Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Reportedly, Tor-Tun can be struck by frost cauldrons multiple times, making them simple to kill or even solo. They drop an average of 6 Earth, but you should bring a skinner if possible as they have very valuable skin. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed.			
				Skinned	Any Cataclysm mob	~	Any	Skinning	FALSE	Phase 1	1	See Wowhead comments for some lovely suggestions of where best to skin. The fact of the matter is, efficiency is leather per time, so mobs with slightly worse drops that you can more easily kill with less competition may be a better source. Make sure that you skin high-level beasties in Uldum and up and don't worry too much about finding a perfect spot instead of one that works well for you.			
				Crafted	Savage Leather Scraps	~	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Scraps serve no purpose other than combining five at a time into leather and are usually less efficient to come by than straight leather. If you have Leatherworking below skill 450, you may get some easy points from doing this. This also means Scraps may be more expensive than the Leather they make, so if you are just combining for the Leather, make sure to check auction house prices of both.			Leather, Savage Leather Scraps
			Savage Leather Scraps												
				Skinned	Low level Cataclysm mobs	~	~	Skinning	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Most mobs in Mount Hyjal, Vashj'ir, and some in Deepholm will provide you with Scraps.			
Meat and Fish	Basilisk "Liver"	#980000													
			Albino Cavefish												
				Fished	Open water & schools		Deepholm	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Only occur in Deepholm in any liquid the zone has. Despite its amazing ability to live in lava and mercury, open water drop rates are quite bad around 10%, so you should consider looking for schools and fishing only there. They are mostly bundled on the east side of the zone, but you should also check Needlerock Chasm.			
			Algaefin Rockfish												
				Drop	Gub's Catch		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.			
				Fished	Ocean water	~	~	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	There are no schools of these, and they don't occur in schools of other fish. They can be caught in the Twilight Highlands, Tol Barad, Darkmoon Island, and Vashj'ir (by poking your head above water in a cave or ship.) Make sure your skill is top notch and don't be discouraged by the 10% drop rate as they are thankfully not all that useful anyway.			
			Basilisk "Liver"												
				Drop	Deepholm Basilisks		Deepholm	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	The best mob to farm is definitely Shalehide Basilisks to the north, even with the troggs around that apply a nasty debuff if you aren't watching. However, any high-level basilisk has a 50% chance to drop their "liver". Just watch out for prions when you eat them.			
				Drop	Spinescale Basilisk		Mount Hyjal		FALSE	Phase 1	2	Completing too many quests in Hyjal will make these basilisks disappear. You would have to almost complete the zone, however. This means you may find less competition from high level players, but instead from low level ones trying to complete the quest you skipped. Any high-level basilisk has a 50% chance to drop their "liver".			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat		~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Blackbelly Mudfish												
				Drop	Gub's Catch		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.			
				Fished	Open water & schools		Uldum	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	1	The odds of fishing a Mudfish from open water are not great, as you may have learned fishing its Nagrandian cousin. However, there are schools of Mudfish spawns all over Uldum's fresh water, and going by old comments there are so many you won't ever run out even with competition.			
			Blood Shrimp												
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Drop	Abyssal Clam		Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Abyssal Clams are dropped by naga, gilblin, murlocs, and Uldum's Neferset. (Because cats like fish.) They contain 1-2 Shrimp each and have a chance for vendor trash pearls.
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat		~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Crocolisk Tail												
				Drop	Baradin Crocolisk		Tol Barad	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Hyperspawn. Found in the swamp west of the fortress, while it is high level, it respawns very fast when farmed and also gives you access to Savage Leather or Whiptail while you are in the area, if you have the proper skills.			
				Drop	Other Cataclysm Crocolisks		Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Most anywhere you can dip a toe into the water in Uldum, you'll find crocs. They each feature a drop chance of just about 50% for tail, which is a lot better than the asses of bears or the brains of basilisks, so don't worry and kill some wherever you like. This is also handily combined with skinning or gathering Whiptail.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat		~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Deepsea Sagefish												
				Fished	Deepsea Sagefish School		Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Spawns along the eastern coast and river delta of the Twilight Highlands. Also drops Azshara's Veil some 10% of the time, which may be more interesting than the fishies.			
				Fished	Ocean water		~	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Found at decent rates in any ocean water touched by a high-level zone.			
				Drop	Gub's Catch		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.			
			Delicate Wing												
				Drop	Diseased Vulture		Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Eating their parasite-riddled meat may be a bad idea (to the point that your character gives themselves a quest to rid the world of them!) but they are plentiful and very easy to kill with a 50% drop rate for Delicate Wings on top, compared to the 25% of other birds. In early builds, completing Put The Baby In The Cradle may phase you out from Diseased Vultures, but in Classic you should still find them higher in the sky. Aggro them on your flying mount and go down to kill them.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Drop	Other Cataclysm birds of prey		~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	All birds that drop Wings have about a 25% chance to do so. Pick one you like and get killing. Noteworthy among them is the Greater Roc between Feralas and Silithus. If all other spots are taken, this out of the way bird not relevant to anything may help.			
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat		~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Dragon Flank												
				Drop	Stonescale Drake		Deepholm	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Literally fall from the sky stunned, wounded, and easy to kill. Reports differ on their actual drop chance, but signs point to it being 50% which is great.			
				Drop	Other Cataclysm Dragons		Mount Hyjal; Deepholm; Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	For the purposes of their meat, dragons don't vary much from a 50% drop chance all round, so find a pretty one and go get its flank.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat		~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Fathom Eel												
				Fished	Fathom Eel Swarm		Uldum; Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Found along Uldum's ocean coast and all over Tol Barad Peninsula, the northern contested zone. Can also contain Volatile Water and Azshara's Veil, when you really just wanted your feast fish.			
				Fished	Ocean water		~	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Found at decent rates in any ocean water touched by a high-level zone.			
				Drop	Gub's Catch		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.			
			Giant Turtle Tongue												
				Drop	Vashj'ir turtles		Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths	Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Given they are not relevant to any quests nor are their drops very useful, it should not be hard to find any of these turtles. Completing the introductory to Vashj'ir is not strictly required but very fast and will make this much easier.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Drop	Tor-Tun		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Reportedly, Tor-Tun can be struck by frost cauldrons multiple times, making them simple to kill or even solo. They drop an average of 6 Earth, but you should bring a skinner if possible as they have very valuable skin. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed. They drop a Tongue occasionally, but you should be more interested in their other drops and skin.			
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat		~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Highland Guppy												
				Fished	Highland Guppy School		Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Only spawns upriver and in Loch Verrall, which makes some sense since despite their name most of the Twilight Highlands are at sea level. It's certainly worth to fish these schools when you find them, but there are two issues: For one, since it is used in the good feast and does not drop from Gub's Catch for some reason, you can expect heavy competition. For two, the schools are linked with Deepsea Sagefish schools along the coast. You can try fishing those out if you can't find any Highland Guppy schools, but others will likely take them while you are at the coast. If there is competition, you may be better off simply fishing open water along the river or loch.			
				Fished	Open water		Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Only found in Loch Verrall and its draining river.			
			Lavascale Catfish												
				Drop	Gub's Catch		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.			
				Fished	Lost City of the Tol'vir		Lost City of the Tol'vir	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	It takes a little effort to get past the initial trash, but once you've made it to the water, fish away. Drops are good and no one's coming to bother you.			
				Fished	Open water		Uldum; Deepholm	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Reportedly, odds are worse in Uldum than in Deepholm, but the data may be skewed since Uldum has a coast and the Lavascale Catfish only appears in fresh water (and lava, and mercury...) Note that it cannot be fished in lava found elsewhere. There are no schools, so fish away at the open water.			
			Monstrous Claw												
				Drop	King Crawler	~	Feralas	~	TRUE	Phase 1	2	Despite being in Feralas, the crawlers are level 83 or 84. They are clustered together and simple to kill where most other mobs dropping Monstrous Claws are underwater. They even have one of the highest drop rates for Deepsea Scales, which is interesting because crabs don't have scales.			
				Drop	Vashj'ir crustaceans		Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths	Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Not all of these mobs are strictly speaking crabs, some of them are quest-relevant, some not. It should be easy to find one that you can grind well, such as Silversand Burrowers in the southeast.			
				Drop	Spiny Tidecrawler		Tol Barad Peninsula	~	FALSE	Phase1	1	If you can't be bothered completing like four quests to get your Vashj'ir sea legs, these crabbos have the same 50% drop rate as any other crab.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat		~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Mountain Trout												
				Fished	Mountain Trout School		Mount Hyjal	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Schools spawn all around the zone in water, and notably on the border between Hyjal and Azshara. Check the waterfalls for profit.			
				Fished	Open water		Mount Hyjal	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Can be fished anywhere here.			
			Murglesnout												
				Fished	Ocean water		~	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Found at rates so high you'll learn to curse its rotten name while it gets in the way of anything useful, in any ocean water touched by a high-level zone.			
			Sharptooth												
				Fished	Open water		Any	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Found at high rates in anything that is not ocean water, including lava, liquid mercury, and the quenching pools of certain forges. Resilient buggers.			
			Snake Eye												
				Drop	Brinescale Serpent		Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest	Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Despite being a serpent and not a snake (toss us nerds an anatomically correct bone, Blizzard!), this is the only farmable mob to drop Snake Eyes.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options.

			Stag Flank												
				Drop	Weakened Mosshoof Stag, Darkshore Stag, Brown Stag		~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Brown Stags can only be found in the Worgen starting zone version of Gilneas, so if you are not a fresh worgen, you'll have to seek your stag butts outside of Orgrimmar or in Darkshore.			
			Striped Lurker												
				Fished	Open fresh water		Mount Hyjal; Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	There are no pools of Striped Lurkers. Simply fish in fresh water and they will come to you in time.			
			Toughened Flesh												
				Drop	Animals without other meat drops		Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	If you are looking for specifically Toughened Flesh, find an animal you like that Blizzard didn't bother making a specific meat for. Examples are hyenas and gazelles in Uldum, dogs in the Twilight Highlands, and high-level elk and stags.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking.

Metal	Pyrite Ore	#cccccc													
			Elementium Bar												
				Crafted	Smelt Elementium	~	~	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	2 Elementium Ore per bar.			Metal, Elementium Ore
			Elementium Ore												
				Drop	Giant Sack		Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Mor'Lek the Dismantler and Kaulema the Mover, respectively in front of the stairs above the Coil (where you used to hand in enchantments) and two right turns uphill from Mor'Lek, this bag contains an average of 11.4 Elementium Ore and two of either Nightstone, Jasper, or Zephyrite. It can be obtained from each of the two trolls per instance. If you don't kill an actual boss, even though Zul'Gurub requires Heroic difficulty, you can simply reset the instance and kill them again.			
				Mined	Elementium Vein		Deepholm; Uldum; Twilight Highlands; Tol Barad Peninsula; Tol Barad	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Rich veins occasionally replace regular spawns. If there were no competition, you would probably be best off farming in Tol Barad with its small search area for many nodes. In practice however, you'll have to contend with countless druids, so my recommendation is to go to Zul'Gurub if possible. If that is not an option, try the areas marked here, look for good routes, and find what works best on your server at the best times for you.			Metal, Elementium Ore, Giant Sack
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Mined	Any minable mob	~	Deepholm	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Most, but not all, minable mobs are found in Deepholm. Note that the ones you can realistically kill have a 5% or lower drop rate, so it seems unlikely farming Elementium would ever be worth doing this way. Take it as a lovely bonus on mobs you were already killing and mining.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Folded Obsidium												
				Crafted	Folded Obsidium	~	~	Blacksmithing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	2 Obsidium Bar per Folded Obsidium. (Even though, really, it's twisted.)			Metal, Obsidium Bar
			Hardened Elementium Bar												
				Crafted	Hardened Elementium Bar	~	~	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Ten Elementium Bars and four Volatile Earth per Hardened bar.			Metal, Elementium Bar; Elemental, Volatile Earth
			Obsidium Bar												
				Crafted	Smelt Obsidium	~	~	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	2 Obsidium Ore per bar.			Metal, Obsidium Ore
			Obsidium Ore												
				Mined	Obsidium Deposit	~	Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths; Mount Hyjal; Deepholm	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Rich veins occasionally replace regular spawns in Deepholm only. If there were no competition, Deepholm would be best for farming. In practice however, you'll have to contend with countless druids. There is not really a better source, so you'll have to try for yourself and figure out what area works best for you. While Vashj'ir may look worthless, consider that you can unlock a seahorse mount with only a few quests that goes very fast even if you don't have master riding skill. This could put you on even footing if you can't afford to give your farming character fast flying.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	~	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Pyrite Ore												
				Mined	Pyrite Deposit		Uldum; Twilight Highlands	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Pyrite Deposits replace Elementium Veins sometimes in the Highlands and Uldum.			
				Mined	Rich Pyrite Deposit		Tol Barad Peninsula; Tol Barad	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	5	Rich Pyrite Deposits only spawn in both halves of Tol Barad, replacing Elementium Vein spawns.			
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.

				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Pyrium Bar												
				Crafted	Smelt Pyrite	~	~	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Two Pyrite Ore per bar.			Metal, Pyrite Ore
				Crafted	Transmute: Pyrium Bar	~	Transmutation with CD	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	One Elementium Bar and one Volatile Earth per transmute. While better than a mouthful of nails, you should try to avoid doing this transmute at all costs. It triggers the 20 hour transmutation cooldown shared with Transmute: Living Elements and Transmute: Truegold, both of which are almost certainly a far better use of your daily cooldown.			Metal, Elementium Bar; Elemental, Volatile Earth; Metal, Truegold, Transmute: Truegold
			Truegold												
				Crafted	Transmute: Truegold	~	Transmutation with CD	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	3 Pyrium Bar and 10 each of Volatile Air, Fire, and Water per bar. Triggers the shared 20 hour transmutation cooldown, but is almost certainly the best use of your daily cooldown if available.			Metal, Pyrium Bar; Elemental, Volatile Air; Elemental, Volatile Fire; Elemental, Volatile Water
Other	Chaos Orb	#45818e													
			Abyssal Clam												
				Drop	Aquatic humanoids and Neferset	~	Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths; Uldum; Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Dropped by Naga, Gilblin, Murlocs, and Neferset Tol'vir (because cats like clams, despite that these clams never have meat.) There are too many mobs to even list. It's a safe assumption that if you are slaying a humanoid which is moist, it'll drop a clam.			
			Chaos Orb												
				Drop	Any heroic dungeon end boss	~	~	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	One Chaos Orb is dropped for the group to share. Prior to 4.3 Orbs were Bind on Pickup, but equivalent items in previous Classic expansions were tradeable immediately.			
			Cocoa Beans												
				Sold	Imported Supplies	~	~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Sold by any cooking supplier for one Epicurean's Award each. The bag always contains at least 40 beans, but may contain more, up to 55. So if you need to buy three bags to acquire 91 for You'll Feel Right As Rain, consider yourself unlucky.			
			Deepstone Oil												
				Crafted	Deepstone	~	~	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	One Albino Cavefish per Oil. There is no alchemy specialisation which could cause you to get extra product, since it's oil and not a potion, elixir, or transmutation.			Meat and Fish, Albino Cavefish
			Draenei Tome												
				Surveyed	Draenei digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a draenei digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. Some say this one will guide you to the Xel'naga if you collect enough!			
			Dwarf Runestone												
				Surveyed	Dwarf digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a dwarf digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. You'd think it would be correctly spelled Dwarven Runestone, but you see, it's a stone that has the "dwarf" rune on it. Yep.
			Essence of Destruction												
				Drop	Any Dragon Soul boss		~	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	As with any other raid material, you'll get this either for free or a very high price. Each boss seems to drop around 0.7 Essences on average. They will not drop them on LFR difficulty.			
			Highborne Scroll												
				Surveyed	Night Elf digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a night elf digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. You could probably just ask the artifact's original owner for guidance, since they're all still around, but that may be a bad idea with some highborne.			
			Living Ember												
				Drop	Any Firelands boss		~	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	As with any other raid material, you'll get this either for free or a very high price. Each boss seems to have around a 33% chance of dropping one, very rarely dropping two.			
			Nerubian Obelisk												
				Surveyed	Nerubian digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a nerubian digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. Sadly, all that we thought to be nerubian culture (like the design of most Scourge buildings!) was actually Maldraxxus all along, so this is near worthless.			
			Orc Blood Text												
				Surveyed	Orc digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in an orc digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. The sheer impracticality of writing in blood deserves its own dissertation, but hey, if it works.			
			Pyrium-Laced Crystalline Vial												
				Sold	Yasmin		Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Tucked in a little valley, not part of any faction so she will not give you discounts for reputation nor for being a goblin, but you can get a discount for being part of a high level guild.			
			Sands of Time												
				Sold	Yasmin		Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Tucked in a little valley, not part of any faction so she will not give you discounts for reputation nor for being a goblin, but you can get a discount for being part of a high level guild.			
			Tol'vir Hieroglyphic												
				Surveyed	Tol'vir digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a Tol'vir digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. If you find one of these, congratulations, you are now 12 fragments closer to not getting that sandstone drake recipe.			
			Troll Tablet												
				Surveyed	Troll digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a troll digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. With trolls having spent ages as basically the only sentient species, you'd think anyone's back yard counts as a troll dig site, but nope, enjoy your travel.			
			Vrykul Rune Stick												
				Surveyed	Vrykul digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a vrykul digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. Just don't worry too much about who sygar whose helmond.
