Cloth	Embersilk Cloth	#FFC687													
			Bolt of Embersilk Cloth												
				Crafted	Bolt of Embersilk Cloth	~	~	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	5 Embersilk Cloth per Bolt			Cloth, Embersilk Cloth
			Dreamcloth												
				Crafted	Dream of Destruction	~	~	Tailoring, Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Uniquely this pattern has no cooldown, but requires 5 (4 if in post-4.3 state) Chaos Orbs instead of Volatile elements.			Cloth, Bolt of Embersilk Cloth; Other, Chaos Orb
				Crafted	Dream of non-Destruction	~	~	Tailoring	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Each pattern has a 7 day cooldown, requires 30 of one Volatile element, and produces one Dreamcloth.			Cloth, Bolt of Embersilk Cloth; Elemental, Volatile Air; Elemental, Volatile Earth; Elemental, Volatile Fire; Elemental, Volatile Life; Elemental, Volatile Water
			Embersilk Cloth												
				Drop	Virtually any humanoid / undead in Cataclysm zones	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Pick any target you can comfortably kill and go to town. Highly skilled Tailors can learn to scavenge significantly more cloth when they loot a monster.			
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else by kills.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	67.9, 53.2	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
Elemental	Volatile Fire	#FF0000													
			Volatile Air												
				Drop	Vortex Pinnacle trash	19.5, 95.6	Vortex Pinnacle	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	A little bonus during regular runs, but also farmable on normal. To farm Air, clear trash up to Altairus (you may also kill the dragon for a chance at the mount, even on normal) and hop off the edge to go safely back to the entrance, then go out and reset.			
				Drop	Hive Queen's Honeycomb	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by the Florawing Hive Queen at the base of the waterfall in the instance's northwest corner. Immediately turn left at the entrance as if heading to Zanzil. She drops one Honeycomb for the group to share, but can be soloed with some effort by some classes. It contains 4-6 each of Twilight Jasmine, Volatile Air, and Volatile Life. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed, however the Honeycomb was made a secret daily reward at some point and may still be so.	31.5, 39.0		
				Drop	Enslaved Tempest	87.2, 59.2	Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	They are high level and spread around an endgame cultist camp, but have decent drop rates of Volatile Air at 0.28 per kill. This is the best you get outside of dungeons.		35.6, 67.2; 37.2, 74.6; 31.2, 71.0|44.6, 80.2; 44.8, 84.8; 39.0, 89.2; 38.2, 84.6	
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Drop	Sweeping Winds	19.0, 89.4	Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	While they were patched in during 4.0.3 as a farmable source of Volatile Air, they still only drop 0.18 Air per kill and are actually slightly tougher than Scions of Al'Akir. Combined, the two make an okay farming spot with no irrelevant mobs around.		36.6, 39.0; 35.8, 47.6; 38.6, 49.6; 43.0, 43.2; 46.0, 51.2; 41.8, 51.6; 37.0, 56.4; 32.8, 56.0; 28.8, 49.2	Elemental, Volatile Air, Scion of Al'Akir
				Drop	Scion of Al'Akir	19.0, 89.4	Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	4	This mob and by extension all the Volatile Air farms being terrible is actually the reason this guide exists. I once thought they were the only open world mob to drop Air. While not true, it's not much better. These guys drop 0.18 Air per kill and require six kills for a mandatory quest. Probably best combined with the Sweeping Winds around them.		39.6, 36.2; 44.4, 36.8; 42.8, 42.2; 40.8, 45.0; 38.6, 47.0; 37.0, 44.8; 37.0, 43.2	Elemental, Volatile Air, Sweeping Winds
				Drop	Storm Vortex	88.2, 55.8	Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Plausible Hyperspawn. Higher level than Howling Riftdwellers and have slightly better drop rate at 0.18 Air per kill, but high level, also mixed with cultists, and quest-relevant.		42.4, 47.2; 41.2, 50.0; 37.4, 47.6; 37.8, 45.6; 39.8, 43.4; 41.8, 44.4	
				Drop	Howling Riftdweller	23.1, 41.5	Mount Hyjal	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Plausible Hyperspawn. Drop rate for Air is very bad at approximately 0.135 Air per kill, they are spread along the ridge alongside cultists, and they must be killed for a quest (though there are many more than needed for the quest.)		22.6, 32.2; 26.6, 38.6; 34.2, 38.6; 31.6, 41.8; 25.2, 43.0	
				Crafted	Transmute: Living Elements	~	Transmutation with CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Transmutes 15 Volatile Life into 14-16 of a "random" element. The element choice can be forced by being in a specific zone: Vashj'ir for Water, Mount Hyjal for Fire, Deepholm for Earth, and Uldum for Air. Alchemists specialised in Transmutation may receive extra Volatiles, which are always random. Shares cooldown with transmuting Pyrite and Truegold, so make sure to research how to best use your daily cooldown.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Drop	Electrostatic Condenser	~	Any	Engineering	FALSE	Phase 1	0	If you have a Condenser in your inventory with good Engineering skill, you gain around a 2% chance to get 1-2 Volatile Air as an additional drop whenever you mine, skin, or herb something. While it's free stuff, it's incredibly marginal and requires you to be an engineer and gatherer. If you are, go craft one, but don't pick up Engineering on all your alts just for this.			Metal; Herb; Leather
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	67.9, 53.2	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Volatile Earth												
				Drop	Tor-Tun	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Reportedly, Tor-Tun can be struck by frost cauldrons multiple times, making them simple to kill or even solo. They drop an average of 6 Earth, but you should bring a skinner if possible as they have very valuable skin. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed.	46.0, 55.6		
				Mined	Any ore deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Simply mining deposits has a very high chance of getting Volatiles. Rich Obsidium Deposits drop more Earth, but any vein is good.			Metal
				Drop	Obsidium Punisher	23.3, 43.8	Molten Front	~	FALSE	Phase 3	1	They are not directly relevant for any quest and are usually seen as more of an annoyance while questing. Requires that you have unlocked the Molten Front, but features a decent 0.28 Earth per kill, 0.25 Earth when mined, and a chance of Elementium Ore.		18.0, 36.8; 19.2, 47.6; 18.0, 46.2; 16.8, 43.0; 17.0, 39.6|23.4, 28.0; 27.4, 27.0; 32.8, 33.6; 27.0, 40.6; 23.6, 32.2|32.0, 42.2; 31.6, 51.0; 29.6, 52.8; 25.4, 52.0; 30.2, 50.4	
				Prospected	Pyrite Ore	~	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Probably not why you are prospecting it, but a handy bonus of an average of 2 Earth per prospect.			
				Mined	Any minable NPC	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Almost every mob that can be mined for Earth is located in Deepholm. See Drop sources for notable mobs that also drop it.			
				Drop	Scalding Rock Elemental	23.8, 38.0	Mount Hyjal	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Extremely plentiful and right next to the portal exit. This makes up for their terrible drop rate of 0.15 Earth per kill and mining for a slight chance of one more, but you'll also have to contend with other farmers and jewelcrafters trying to complete their dailies.		58.4, 22.4; 61.8, 20.4; 60.2, 22.4|64.6, 19.6; 66.0, 19.0; 68.6, 23.8; 68.4, 26.6; 64.6, 25.8	
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Drop	Obsidian Stoneslave	88.6, 56.7	Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Around 0.2 Earth per kill plus being minable for another 0.2 and a slight chance of Elementium Ore. Decent drops, but quest-relevant and their rupture line ability deals a lot of damage if you are not paying attention.		57.6, 26.6; 61.4, 31.0; 60.6, 34.6; 56.4, 32.6; 54.8, 30.6; 55.8, 27.2	
				Drop	Lava Surger	23.7, 40.6	Mount Hyjal	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Only 0.15 Earth per kill, but can be mined for a slight chance of more. Not visible if you complete the quests in their area.		27.4, 51.6; 30.6, 51.0; 32.6, 52.4; 29.0, 56.6|33.8, 52.8; 36.6, 51.0; 40.2, 52.8; 42.2, 55.8; 41.8, 60.6; 39.6, 61.8; 35.8, 59.2; 33.8, 65.0; 32.0, 60.4, 33.6, 58.0	
				Drop	Molten Tormentor	22.8, 39.3	Mount Hyjal	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Hidden in an unmountable cave, quest relevant, and cannot be mined for extra drops, while also dropping only around 0.15 Earth per kill.		62.4, 51.2; 63.8, 52.8; 63.6, 53.8; 61.4, 57.4|64.2, 58.6; 65.6, 57.2; 65.6, 59.6; 63.6, 62.2	
				Crafted	Transmute: Living Elements	~	Transmutation with CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Transmutes 15 Volatile Life into 14-16 of a "random" element. The element choice can be forced by being in a specific zone: Vashj'ir for Water, Mount Hyjal for Fire, Deepholm for Earth, and Uldum for Air. Alchemists specialised in Transmutation may receive extra Volatiles, which are always random. Shares cooldown with transmuting Pyrite and Truegold, so make sure to research how to best use your daily cooldown.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	67.9, 53.2	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Volatile Fire												
				Drop	Enslaved Inferno	88.2, 55.8	Twilight Highlands		FALSE	Phase 1	2	Cultists are annoying, but their drop rate of 0.28 Fire per kill is the highest other than Magma Giants and Molten Front mobs and you can fish Pools of Fire in the same area. If you can kill them decently well, this is the best farm before phase 3.		37.8, 76.8; 39.8, 78.0; 43.2, 78.4; 43.8, 79.6; 42.0, 80.8; 37.0, 80.0	Elemental, Volatile Fire, Pool of Fire: Twilight Highlands
				Drop	Molten Front fire elementals	23.3, 43.8	Molten Front	Quest	FALSE	Phase 3	1	Some mobs added in phase 2 that drop Fire are in Mount Hyjal, but all of them are level 85 and drop 0.28 Fire per kill. In order, you want to look at Charred Vanquishers (best by far, easy to farm), Flame Terrors, Brimstone Destroyers, Flamewatch Sentinels, Charred Invaders, and Seething Pyrelords. Some require questing to be visible, some require that you can enter the Molten Front.			
				Drop	Magma Giant	22.3, 42.5	Mount Hyjal	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	1	While elite, they can be slowed and CCed, allowing many classes to take them out solo. They drop an average of 0.3 Fire per kill, which isn't a lot, but can be woven in between fishing Pools of Fire.		52.6, 71.2; 58.4, 75.2; 58.6, 76.6; 51.0, 71.6|52.6, 81.8; 52.2, 86.6; 52.4, 81.6|42.4, 86.4; 44.0, 84.4; 46.4, 86.0; 43.4, 88.6	Elemental, Volatile Fire, Pool of Fire: Mount Hyjal
				Drop	Twilight Highlands fire elementals	88.6, 56.7	Twilight Highlands		FALSE	Phase 1	2	Not including Enslaved Infernos, which are a better source by drop rate, all of these elementals drop an average of 0.18 Fire per kill. Magmalord Falthazar, Unbound Emberfiend, and Bound Fleshburner are located in the Twilight camp northwest of Thundermar. Subjugated Firestarters are near Firebeard's Patrol, but do NOT drop any loot!		39.6, 14.0; 41.6, 14.4; 42.6, 15.4; 42.6, 17.8; 40.2, 19.6; 39.0, 16.4|41.2, 20.4; 43.4, 21.2; 43.8, 23.6; 43.6, 26.2; 41.2, 24.6; 40.0, 21.8	
				Drop	Mount Hyjal fire elementals	23.7, 38.3	Mount Hyjal		FALSE	Phase 1	2	For all of these, you can distinguish them by being added in phase 1 and not being level 85. Their drop rate for Fire is frankly terrible at 0.15 Fire per kill. The only difference between them is other mobs being present. In order, I'd look at Blazebound Elementals, Searing Guardians, Raging Firestorms, Flame Ascendants, Fiery Tormentors, Fiery Instructors, and Unbound Fire Elementals.			
				Fished	Pool of Fire: Mount Hyjal	22.3, 42.5	Mount Hyjal	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Can only be fished from Pools of Fire. Two will spawn at a time and emptying one should cause another to spawn quickly until all 4 spawn points have been emptied, at which point the respawn timer must be waited out. Reports vary between exactly 15 minutes to respawn down to 5-10.		47.9, 74.1; 50.6, 75.3; 52.2, 78.6; 50.3, 82.5	
				Fished	Pool of Fire: Twilight Highlands	88.2, 55.8	Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Can only be fished from Pools of Fire. Two will spawn at a time and emptying one should cause another to spawn quickly until all 4 spawn points have been emptied, at which point the respawn timer must be waited out. Reports vary between exactly 15 minutes to respawn down to 5-10.		41.3, 79.6; 41.8, 80.9; 40.6, 81.1	
				Mined	Elementium Deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	0.15 Fire per vein, while Riches give 0.25. Not a good concentrated source, but a lovely bonus on top.			Metal, Elementium Ore
				Mined	Pyrite Deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	0.15 Fire per deposit, while Riches give 0.25. Not a good concentrated source, but a lovely bonus on top.			Metal, Pyrite Ore
				Crafted	Transmute: Living Elements	~	Transmutation with CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Transmutes 15 Volatile Life into 14-16 of a "random" element. The element choice can be forced by being in a specific zone: Vashj'ir for Water, Mount Hyjal for Fire, Deepholm for Earth, and Uldum for Air. Alchemists specialised in Transmutation may receive extra Volatiles, which are always random. Shares cooldown with transmuting Pyrite and Truegold, so make sure to research how to best use your daily cooldown.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	67.9, 53.2	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Volatile Life												
				Gathered	Any herb	~	Any	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Like with Earth and miners, the best source of these are herbalists. They just passively generate them. All herbs drop an average of 1 Volatile Life when gathered.			Herb
				Drop	Hive Queen's Honeycomb	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by the Florawing Hive Queen at the base of the waterfall in the instance's northwest corner. Immediately turn left at the entrance as if heading to Zanzil. She drops one Honeycomb for the group to share, but can be soloed with some effort by some classes. It contains 4-6 each of Twilight Jasmine, Volatile Air, and Volatile Life. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed, however the Honeycomb was made a secret daily reward at some point and may still be so.	31.5, 39.0		
				Gathered	Fungal Behemoth	51.6, 51.1	Deepholm	Herbalism	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Drops 0.15 Life when gathered after being looted.		69.4, 31.4; 73.6, 31.4; 75.6, 36.2; 75.6, 41.6; 77.6, 46.0; 77.2, 50.8; 76.4, 44.6; 74.6, 42.4; 72.6, 44.8; 72.0, 48.6; 70.8, 48.8; 68.8, 40.8; 68.4, 33.2; 69.8, 31.4; 70.4, 32.6; 69.0, 36.0; 70.6, 40.2; 73.2, 39.2; 74.6, 36.8; 72.6, 32.2	
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	67.9, 53.2	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Volatile Water												
				Drop	Enslaved Waterspout	88.2, 55.8	Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Plausible Hyperspawn. They are quest-relevant and very underwater, but that should not be a problem. When killed, they express their gratitude which makes it hard to loot them, but waiting a few seconds (while killing another) will make their 0.3 Water easily lootable.		33.0, 55.8; 35.6, 56.6; 36.2, 61.4; 33.6, 63.6; 31.8, 66.8; 26.6, 66.2; 26.2, 65.2; 28.6, 59.6	
				Drop	Muddied Water Elemental	89.0, 57.7	Twilight Highlands		FALSE	Phase 1	1	Plausible Hyperspawn. Quest-relevant to both factions, but on dry land. Drop 0.18 Volatile Water each and are very easy to kill.		64.0, 41.4; 69.8, 48.2; 70.8, 50.6; 68.8, 50.6; 67.6, 52.2; 66.4, 47.6; 64.4, 44.8; 63.4, 42.0	
				Drop	Compelled Elemental	67.8, 68.4	Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths		FALSE	Phase 1	1	Found inside the big snail. At 0.15 Water per kill, cultists around, and a bad population, while also being very out of the way, they are not a great farm but a good place for when you don't want to talk to anyone.		30.0, 55.2; 30.0, 59.8; 31.4, 60.6; 34.2, 60.0; 35.0, 63.4; 31.6, 65.6; 27.2, 61.0; 27.0, 54.4	
				Fished	Any school of fish	~	Any	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Odds are not great, but they are a lovely bonus when acquiring fish, unless the fish are worth more than Volatile Water since Volatiles count as a catch for depleting the school.			Meat
				Mined	Elementium Deposit	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	0.15 Water per vein, while Riches give 0.25. Not a good concentrated source, but a lovely bonus on top.			Metal, Elementium Ore
				Crafted	Transmute: Living Elements	~	Transmutation with CD	Alchemy	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Transmutes 15 Volatile Life into 14-16 of a "random" element. The element choice can be forced by being in a specific zone: Vashj'ir for Water, Mount Hyjal for Fire, Deepholm for Earth, and Uldum for Air. Alchemists specialised in Transmutation may receive extra Volatiles, which are always random. Shares cooldown with transmuting Pyrite and Truegold, so make sure to research how to best use your daily cooldown.			
				Drop	Water-Filled Gills	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Lost Offspring of Gahz'ranka in the waters surrounding the central temple. The Gills contain an average of 19 Volatile Water, however the drop chance for the Gills is only 1.2% to begin with. This gives the Offspring an expected 0.23 Water per kill.

				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Skinned	Strange Bloated Stomach	~	Any	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Rarely is skinned from Cataclysm mobs. Drops 1-2 Air, Earth, Fire, Life, or Water. If you have an Electrostatic Condenser in your inventory, you always receive an additional 1-2 Air (only fair, given the Stomach is a rare drop to begin with.)			Elemental, Volatile Air, Electrostatic Condenser
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	67.9, 53.2	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
				Fished	Any water	~	Any	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	While you can get Volatiles fishing in open water, the drop rate is so low that selling whatever else you fish up will buy you many more Volatiles than you get directly.

Can be found on the northeastern edge of the instance, either turning left at the entrance and travelling east along the path or going straight until one passes the Cache of Madness.

There are three dailies to cut 3 Jaspers, Zephyrites, or Nightstones, for which you must cut them yourself while on the quest and perfects don't count; One daily to beat up elementals for 10 goo (doable in Hyjal, but being level 80 makes it much simpler to teleport there); And one daily to apply a provided item to any 10 humanoids.

				Skinned	Any Cataclysm mob	~	Any	Skinning	FALSE	Phase 1	1	See Wowhead comments for some lovely suggestions of where best to skin. The fact of the matter is, efficiency is leather per time, so mobs with slightly worse drops that you can more easily kill with less competition may be a better source. Make sure that you skin high-level beasties in Uldum and up and don't worry too much about finding a perfect spot instead of one that works well for you.			
				Crafted	Savage Leather Scraps	~	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Scraps serve no purpose other than combining five at a time into leather and are usually less efficient to come by than straight leather. If you have Leatherworking below skill 450, you may get some easy points from doing this. This also means Scraps may be more expensive than the Leather they make, so if you are just combining for the Leather, make sure to check auction house prices of both.

They are mostly bundled on the east side of the zone, but you should also check Needlerock Chasm.		75.8, 31.5; 78.6, 40.4; 79.0, 44.5; 78.1, 53.7; 76.6, 54.6; 78.0, 43.9; 74.5, 41.5; 71.7, 42.8; 70.5, 48.6; 69.3, 46.0; 69.4, 42.7; 70.3, 41.3; 75.2, 40.4; 75.1, 34.7|70.9, 36.5; 70.9, 37.8; 68.4, 37.5; 68.4, 36.8|71.5, 58.4; 72.9, 58.9; 74.5, 60.3; 75.9, 64.6; 76.1, 66.8; 75.6, 67.8; 71.3, 63.6|67.5, 67.3; 68.6, 70.1; 71.5, 69.5; 71.0, 70.7; 70.2, 71.0; 67.4, 70.7; 66.8, 69.4|60.5, 57.0; 62.6, 62.2; 56.0, 59.0; 59.6, 56.4|47.0, 87.9; 47.9, 88.9; 47.5, 89.9; 45.2, 89.4; 46.4, 88.1|27.5, 27.3; 31.5, 31.2; 30.3, 35.1; 27.7, 40.4; 26.5, 41.8; 25.6, 37.5; 23.0, 35.1; 26.0, 31.9; 26.9, 30.1	
			Algaefin Rockfish												
				Drop	Gub's Catch	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.	41.3, 44.5		
				Fished	Ocean water	~	~	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	There are no schools of these, and they don't occur in schools of other fish. They can be caught in the Twilight Highlands, Tol Barad, Darkmoon Island, and Vashj'ir (by poking your head above water in a cave or ship.) Make sure your skill is top notch and don't be discouraged by the 10% drop rate as they are thankfully not all that useful anyway.			
			Basilisk "Liver"												
				Drop	Deepholm Basilisks	51.6, 51.1	Deepholm	~	FALSE	Phase 1	2	The best mob to farm is definitely Shalehide Basilisks to the north, even with the troggs around that apply a nasty debuff if you aren't watching. However, any high-level basilisk has a 50% chance to drop their "liver". Just watch out for prions when you eat them.		46.6, 17.4; 47.0, 22.8; 45.0, 28.8; 42.0, 32.6; 38.6, 32.8; 37.2, 31.6; 35.4, 25.8; 35.8, 22.2; 38.0, 19.8|72.4, 26.4; 73.6, 26.8; 74.0, 28.0; 69.0, 36.0; 68.6, 36.8; 68.4, 35.6; 69.0, 31.4|60.6, 81.6; 60.6, 83.0; 58.2, 88.6; 57.2, 88.6; 56.2, 85.6; 52.0, 85.2; 51.4, 83.2; 51.6, 81.2; 57.2, 83.2; 59.4, 81.8	
				Drop	Spinescale Basilisk	23.8, 40.6	Mount Hyjal		FALSE	Phase 1	2	Completing too many quests in Hyjal will make these basilisks disappear. You would have to almost complete the zone, however. This means you may find less competition from high level players, but instead from low level ones trying to complete the quest you skipped. Any high-level basilisk has a 50% chance to drop their "liver".		80.6, 51.2; 83.0, 51.6; 86.4, 53.2; 87.6, 52.8; 87.4, 49.0; 90.6, 48.6; 90.2, 51.4; 88.8, 54.6; 86.6, 56.8; 83.6, 56.8	
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.	57.4, 27.6		
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat	~	~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Blackbelly Mudfish												
				Drop	Gub's Catch	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.	41.3, 44.5		
				Fished	Open water & schools	19.7, 89.4	Uldum	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	1	The odds of fishing a Mudfish from open water are not great, as you may have learned fishing its Nagrandian cousin. However, there are schools of Mudfish spawns all over Uldum's fresh water, and going by old comments there are so many you won't ever run out even with competition.			
			Blood Shrimp												
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go.

				Drop	Abyssal Clam	66.4, 65.9	Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Abyssal Clams are dropped by naga, gilblin, murlocs, and Uldum's Neferset. (Because cats like fish.) They contain 1-2 Shrimp each and have a chance for vendor trash pearls.			
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat	~	~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards.

			Crocolisk Tail												
				Drop	Baradin Crocolisk	67.9, 53.2	Tol Barad	~	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Hyperspawn. Found in the swamp west of the fortress, while it is high level, it respawns very fast when farmed and also gives you access to Savage Leather or Whiptail while you are in the area, if you have the proper skills.		39.6, 39.6; 40.8, 42.4; 45.6, 43.2; 45.4, 46.6; 43.8, 50.6; 44.8, 56.0; 42.6, 53.6; 40.6, 55.6; 37.8, 55.6; 35.8, 53.2; 34.4, 47.6; 34.6, 42.4; 37.4, 42.4	
				Drop	Other Cataclysm Crocolisks	19.7, 89.4	Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Most anywhere you can dip a toe into the water in Uldum, you'll find crocs. They each feature a drop chance of just about 50% for tail, which is a lot better than the asses of bears or the brains of basilisks, so don't worry and kill some wherever you like. This is also handily combined with skinning or gathering Whiptail.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options.

			Deepsea Sagefish												
				Fished	Deepsea Sagefish School	87.8, 56.4	Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Spawns along the eastern coast and river delta of the Twilight Highlands. Also drops Azshara's Veil some 10% of the time, which may be more interesting than the fishies.			
				Fished	Ocean water	~	~	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Found at decent rates in any ocean water touched by a high-level zone.			
				Drop	Gub's Catch	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.	41.3, 44.5		
			Delicate Wing												
				Drop	Diseased Vulture	18.7, 89.1	Uldum		FALSE	Phase 1	2	Eating their parasite-riddled meat may be a bad idea (to the point that your character gives themselves a quest to rid the world of them!) but they are plentiful and very easy to kill with a 50% drop rate for Delicate Wings on top, compared to the 25% of other birds. In early builds, completing Put The Baby In The Cradle may phase you out from Diseased Vultures, but in Classic you should still find them higher in the sky. Aggro them on your flying mount and go down to kill them.		47.6, 67.8; 46.2, 69.0; 46.8, 72.6; 45.4, 73.6; 43.6, 73.6; 41.2, 72.4; 40.2, 66.2; 41.6, 64.8; 44.4, 67.6	
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go.

The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options.

				Drop	Other Cataclysm birds of prey	16.0, 78.9	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	All birds that drop Wings have about a 25% chance to do so. Pick one you like and get killing. Noteworthy among them is the Greater Roc between Feralas and Silithus. If all other spots are taken, this out of the way bird not relevant to anything may help.			
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat	~	~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies.

			Dragon Flank												
				Drop	Stone Drake	51.6, 51.1	Deepholm	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Literally fall from the sky stunned, wounded, and easy to kill. Reports differ on their actual drop chance, but signs point to it being 50% which is great.		37.6, 16.8; 37.6, 18.6; 37.0, 20.0; 34.6, 21.2; 33.2, 20.6; 33.6, 19.2; 35.4, 16.2	
				Drop	Other Cataclysm Dragons	87.8, 56.4	Mount Hyjal; Deepholm; Twilight Highlands	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	For the purposes of their meat, dragons don't vary much from a 50% drop chance all round, so find a pretty one and go get its flank.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go.

			Fathom Eel												
				Fished	Fathom Eel Swarm	19.7, 89.4	Uldum; Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Found along Uldum's ocean coast and all over Tol Barad Peninsula, the northern contested zone. Can also contain Volatile Water and Azshara's Veil, when you really just wanted your feast fish.			
				Fished	Ocean water	~	~	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Found at decent rates in any ocean water touched by a high-level zone.			
				Drop	Gub's Catch	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.	41.3, 44.5		
			Giant Turtle Tongue												
				Drop	Vashj'ir turtles	66.4, 65.9	Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths	Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Given they are not relevant to any quests nor are their drops very useful, it should not be hard to find any of these turtles. Completing the introductory to Vashj'ir is not strictly required but very fast and will make this much easier.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.	57.4, 27.6		
				Drop	Tor-Tun	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Reportedly, Tor-Tun can be struck by frost cauldrons multiple times, making them simple to kill or even solo. They drop an average of 6 Earth, but you should bring a skinner if possible as they have very valuable skin. You can reset and go again if no actual bosses have been killed. They drop a Tongue occasionally, but you should be more interested in their other drops and skin.	46.0, 55.6		
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat	~	~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities.

			Highland Guppy												
				Fished	Highland Guppy School	87.8, 56.4	Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Only spawns upriver and in Loch Verrall, which makes some sense since despite their name most of the Twilight Highlands are at sea level. It's certainly worth to fish these schools when you find them, but there are two issues: For one, since it is used in the good feast and does not drop from Gub's Catch for some reason, you can expect heavy competition. For two, the schools are linked with Deepsea Sagefish schools along the coast. You can try fishing those out if you can't find any Highland Guppy schools, but others will likely take them while you are at the coast. If there is competition, you may be better off simply fishing open water along the river or loch.		26.9, 62.1; 33.1, 58.6; 35.4, 59.0; 42.3, 54.5; 35.4, 61.1; 34.4, 64.2; 28.4, 66.0|49.6, 42.3; 56.2, 37.0; 62.9, 41.3	
				Fished	Open water	87.8, 56.4	Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Only found in Loch Verrall and its draining river.			
			Lavascale Catfish												
				Drop	Gub's Catch	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Gub, catcher of Gub's Catch. He is located on the bridge leading north to Hakkar's temple, immediately left after going straight at the entrance and crossing the first bridge. Always drops his catch which contains 18-20 of one of Fathom Eel, Deepsea Sagefish, Lavascale Catfish, or Algaefin Rockfish. There is only one Catch for the group to share, however, he does not lock you to Zul'Gurub when defeated and can be struck by multiple applications of the frost cauldron, making him easy to kill, reset, and farm.	41.3, 44.5		
				Fished	Lost City of the Tol'vir	20.3, 89.2	Lost City of the Tol'vir	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	It takes a little effort to get past the initial trash, but once you've made it to the water, fish away. Drops are good and no one's coming to bother you.			
				Fished	Open water	51.6, 51.1	Uldum; Deepholm	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Reportedly, odds are worse in Uldum than in Deepholm, but the data may be skewed since Uldum has a coast and the Lavascale Catfish only appears in fresh water (and lava, and mercury...) Note that it cannot be fished in lava found elsewhere. There are no schools, so fish away at the open water.		::75.8, 31.5; 78.6, 40.4; 79.0, 44.5; 78.1, 53.7; 76.6, 54.6; 78.0, 43.9; 74.5, 41.5; 71.7, 42.8; 70.5, 48.6; 69.3, 46.0; 69.4, 42.7; 70.3, 41.3; 75.2, 40.4; 75.1, 34.7|70.9, 36.5; 70.9, 37.8; 68.4, 37.5; 68.4, 36.8|71.5, 58.4; 72.9, 58.9; 74.5, 60.3; 75.9, 64.6; 76.1, 66.8; 75.6, 67.8; 71.3, 63.6|67.5, 67.3; 68.6, 70.1; 71.5, 69.5; 71.0, 70.7; 70.2, 71.0; 67.4, 70.7; 66.8, 69.4|60.5, 57.0; 62.6, 62.2; 56.0, 59.0; 59.6, 56.4|47.0, 87.9; 47.9, 88.9; 47.5, 89.9; 45.2, 89.4; 46.4, 88.1|27.5, 27.3; 31.5, 31.2; 30.3, 35.1; 27.7, 40.4; 26.5, 41.8; 25.6, 37.5; 23.0, 35.1; 26.0, 31.9; 26.9, 30.1	
			Monstrous Claw												
				Drop	King Crawler	16.0, 78.9	Feralas	~	TRUE	Phase 1	2	Despite being in Feralas, the crawlers are level 83 or 84. They are clustered together and simple to kill where most other mobs dropping Monstrous Claws are underwater. They even have one of the highest drop rates for Deepsea Scales, which is interesting because crabs don't have scales.		75.8, 68.2; 75.8, 74.0; 73.6, 75.6; 68.2, 76.8; 67.0, 75.6; 66.6, 69.0; 68.2, 74.8; 71.4, 72.6; 72.0, 69.0

It should be easy to find one that you can grind well, such as Silversand Burrowers in the southeast.			
				Drop	Spiny Tidecrawler	67.9, 53.0	Tol Barad Peninsula	~	FALSE	Phase1	1	If you can't be bothered completing like four quests to get your Vashj'ir sea legs, these crabbos have the same 50% drop rate as any other crab.		49.0, 14.0; 52.6, 18.6; 49.8, 23.4; 49.6, 27.0; 55.0, 33.0; 52.2, 36.6; 48.2, 30.6; 47.8, 26.8; 41.6, 19.4; 41.2, 17.0; 45.6, 15.0|38.6, 49.8; 36.4, 51.0; 31.6,51.6; 32.8, 50.2	
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.	57.4, 27.6

Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Mountain Trout												
				Fished	Mountain Trout School	23.8, 40.6	Mount Hyjal	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Schools spawn all around the zone in water, and notably on the border between Hyjal and Azshara. Check the waterfalls for profit.			
				Fished	Open water	23.8, 43.6	Mount Hyjal	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Can be fished anywhere here.			
			Murglesnout												
				Fished	Ocean water	~	~	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Found at rates so high you'll learn to curse its rotten name while it gets in the way of anything useful, in any ocean water touched by a high-level zone.			
			Sharptooth												
				Fished	Open water	~	Any	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Found at high rates in anything that is not ocean water, including lava, liquid mercury, and the quenching pools of certain forges. Resilient buggers.			
			Snake Eye												
				Drop	Brinescale Serpent	68.9, 62.4	Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest	Quest	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Despite being a serpent and not a snake (toss us nerds an anatomically correct bone, Blizzard!), this is the only farmable mob to drop Snake Eyes.		57.8, 35.0; 59.2, 40.2; 58.0, 40.6; 55.2, 38.8; 55.2, 37.6; 56.6, 35.4	
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options. Killing only minibosses like the Master Chef does NOT lock you to Zul'Gurub, allowing you to reset the instance and kill them again.	57.4, 27.6		
				Sold	Crate of Tasty Meat	~	~	Cooking	FALSE	Phase 2	0	May be purchased for two Epicurean's Awards each from cooking suppliers in your capital cities. Contains two slots which are each 2-5 of any Cataclysm meat including the same one twice, like the Small Spice Bag awarded from Dalaran cooking dailies. You should prioritise getting the recipes you want as 7 random meat, 14 mob kills' worth, isn't a lot for two days of awards. However, the daily quests require only character level 10 and Cooking 1, so any alts you have can quickly complete dailies and purchase meat to be cooked by your main.			
			Stag Flank												
				Drop	Weakened Mosshoof Stag, Darkshore Stag, Brown Stag	~	~	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Brown Stags can only be found in the Worgen starting zone version of Gilneas, so if you are not a fresh worgen, you'll have to seek your stag butts outside of Orgrimmar or in Darkshore.			
			Striped Lurker												
				Fished	Open fresh water	23.8, 40.6	Mount Hyjal; Twilight Highlands	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	There are no pools of Striped Lurkers. Simply fish in fresh water and they will come to you in time.			
			Toughened Flesh												
				Drop	Animals without other meat drops	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	1	If you are looking for specifically Toughened Flesh, find an animal you like that Blizzard didn't bother making a specific meat for. Examples are hyenas and gazelles in Uldum, dogs in the Twilight Highlands, and high-level elk and stags.			
				Drop	Master Chef's Groceries	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Getting to the Master Chef is a bit dangerous, requiring a half-halo path whichever direction you go. He is located in a hut in the northeastern corner of Zul'Gurub. Make sure not to miss him as he is neutral (yellow), minding his own cooking. The Groceries box contains 18-20 of a random Cataclysm meat, seemingly preferring Snake Eyes with double the drop rates of all other options.

Metal	Elementium Ore	#cccccc													
			Elementium Bar												
				Crafted	Smelt Elementium	~	~	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	2 Elementium Ore per bar.			Metal, Elementium Ore
			Elementium Ore												
				Drop	Giant Sack	78.6, 87.4	Zul'Gurub	Group	FALSE	Phase 2	0	Dropped by Mor'Lek the Dismantler and Kaulema the Mover, respectively in front of the stairs above the Coil (where you used to hand in enchantments) and two right turns uphill from Mor'Lek, this bag contains an average of 11.4 Elementium Ore and two of either Nightstone, Jasper, or Zephyrite. It can be obtained from each of the two trolls per instance. If you don't kill an actual boss, even though Zul'Gurub requires Heroic difficulty, you can simply reset the instance and kill them again.	53.2, 62.8; 56.6, 55.7		
				Mined	Elementium Vein	~	Deepholm; Uldum; Twilight Highlands; Tol Barad Peninsula; Tol Barad	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	4	Rich veins occasionally replace regular spawns. If there were no competition, you would probably be best off farming in Tol Barad with its small search area for many nodes. In practice however, you'll have to contend with countless druids, so my recommendation is to go to Zul'Gurub if possible. If that is not an option, try the areas marked here, look for good routes, and find what works best on your server at the best times for you.		59.8, 32.5; 62.3, 30.3; 63.2, 22.1; 68.1, 23.8; 73.8, 28.8; 75.6, 36.5; 77.5, 46.5; 68.8, 48.8; 69.4, 56.0; 74.5, 60.3; 75.9, 63.9; 75.8, 67.5; 70.9, 65.3; 71.5, 75.9; 63.5, 84.5; 60.0, 84.5; 57.1, 88.9; 54.2, 84.6; 48.1, 88.5; 40.5, 88.5; 36.2, 83.5; 32.6, 84.4; 27.0, 77.5; 24.2, 68.8; 20.2, 57.0; 21.4, 46.5; 26.0, 41.3; 23.1, 35.3; 26.8, 30.6; 27.2, 27.3; 28.9, 22.0; 39.4, 13.2; 44.5, 11.1; 49.2, 14.0; 46.7, 19.5; 52.8, 20.5; 47.7, 27.1; 48.9, 33.0; 53.8, 34.1; 59.8, 32.5::25.8, 7.1; 33.0, 9.2; 43.6, 6.1; 41.1, 10.0; 41.3, 12.7; 40.1, 15.9; 35.7, 22.9; 38.3, 29.3; 37.6, 36.5; 32.4, 34.8; 23.1, 49.3; 26.7, 37.0; 27.5, 22.6; 27.3, 15.8|18.8, 52.7; 18.0, 56.6; 15.4, 59.7; 18.3, 52.0|23.5, 64.5; 26.3, 64.1; 26.7, 66.0|46.2, 27.6; 48.3, 30.7; 46.3, 36.5; 45.0, 27.3|49.5, 46.9; 49.8, 54.9; 53.6, 54.2; 57.2, 58.1; 51.5, 62.2; 49.8, 66.0; 44.5, 65.3; 40.9, 63.2; 40.8, 58.9; 38.3, 54.9; 41.0, 51.7; 44.4, 54.9; 48.6, 46.1|54.3, 73.0; 55.2, 73.9; 54.5, 76.5; 52.5, 73.0|46.1, 77.0; 44.6, 78.9; 43.7, 78.7|65.7, 57.5; 70.9, 62.1; 70.8, 72.1; 70.2, 67.7; 64.5, 57.7|61.7, 50.6; 63.4, 50.4; 62.5, 51.2|77.9, 46.1; 81.1, 45.3; 82.2, 45.8; 81.4, 47.6; 78.2, 46.9|80.9, 54.6; 81.8, 55.2; 81.2, 58.0|69.0, 30.0; 70.1, 36.3; 72.6, 39.2; 72.1, 42.3; 68.6, 36.6; 65.4, 34.7; 60.9, 30.3; 61.7, 28.0; 65.8, 33.1; 68.1, 29.8|43.6, 6.1; 46.7, 7.7; 49.3, 11.8; 55.4, 11.5; 56.0, 12.5; 55.6, 14.7; 49.2, 13.6; 43.1, 6.7|58.3, 13.0; 61.1, 14.8; 61.4, 13.1; 65.2, 14.4; 69.0, 18.3; 69.5, 26.4; 68.2, 20.1; 65.2, 17.5; 62.5, 17.5; 58.3, 19.7::18.5, 16.3; 20.3, 14.0; 24.5, 15.0; 27.0, 16.9; 22.5, 21.7; 20.1, 20.7; 18.7, 17.6|32.2, 30.5; 31.6, 35.4; 31.9, 37.5; 33.1, 38.8; 33.1, 40.7; 31.0, 43.3; 31.3, 48.5; 28.5, 51.8; 29.8, 54.6; 29.0, 56.2; 25.3, 56.7; 17.7, 63.2; 17.2, 56.7; 19.2, 56.9; 27.7, 51.4; 29.5, 45.5; 29.2, 42.7; 25.5, 39.1; 26.3, 36.7; 29.5, 34.3|35.9, 52.4; 37.7, 56.3; 38.2, 62.9; 39.6, 70.5; 41.0, 75.6; 42.3, 76.2; 43.3, 85.5; 47.8, 85.9; 49.2, 87.9; 45.1, 93.6; 43.8, 93.0; 43.7, 89.7; 41.6, 88.5; 39.9, 88.9; 38.3, 95.1; 37.5, 96.1; 37.0, 95.6; 36.5, 93.5; 32.8, 88.5; 36.3, 80.7; 37.1, 76.2; 33.1, 71.1; 25.6, 70.0; 25.3, 65.8; 25.9, 62.9; 27.6, 60.0; 30.2, 58.6; 35.2, 59.4|48.2, 78.1; 49.5, 77.3; 52.0, 79.1; 59.2, 75.7; 59.0, 77.5; 57.0, 79.2; 55.7, 85.7; 49.9, 82.8|37.8, 16.0; 39.3, 21.5; 42.3, 29.6; 37.8, 32.5; 37.9, 41.3; 36.3, 47.6; 34.6, 47.9; 34.6, 47.9; 36.4, 45.2; 35.9, 35.3; 37.6, 26.2; 36.2, 24.7; 34.9, 21.6; 34.8, 19.3|40.7, 45.2; 40.6, 47.9; 40.2, 47.6|51.8, 50.9; 53.5, 60.9; 48.4, 61.1|56.3, 48.3; 59.1, 49.1; 57.6, 55.7|41.7, 20.5; 49.0, 20.5; 50.4, 17.9; 54.1, 19.7; 54.8, 22.5; 62.0, 28.1; 69.5, 35.6; 67.2, 39.7; 66.1, 39.7; 64.7, 35.2; 61.5, 31.0; 57.4, 25.5; 51.4, 23.1; 46.7, 22.1|60.7, 11.5; 58.3, 21.6; 57.6, 18.7; 58.2, 14.2|65.3, 18.4; 67.2, 18.3; 66.8, 20.0; 65.5, 20.7|43.9, 50.0; 47.6, 40.2; 53.5, 35.4; 58.0, 34.9; 66.6, 42.8; 68.8, 44.0; 70.8, 48.8; 67.0, 54.0; 64.7, 46.5; 60.6, 40.2; 58.0, 40.6; 54.8, 39.7; 52.0, 42.8; 51.0, 46.0; 48.2, 50.4; 44.6, 51.8::62.0, 31.1; 69.6, 40.2; 65.2, 37.5|74.9, 45.8; 82.1, 45.1; 80.9, 51.4|68.5, 65.6; 69.3, 74.4; 57.6, 74.8|41.5, 85.9; 36.9, 87.6; 29.7, 82.1|35.7, 61.4; 46.5, 71.6; 41.2, 66.5|41.5, 30.4; 44.6, 39.1; 37.5, 35.6|45.1, 27.6; 48.5, 22.5; 51.5, 30.8::70.2, 29.5; 73.7, 38.7; 68.0, 39.0|67.7, 51.5; 69.7, 60.1; 64.5, 55.6|53.5, 73.2; 54.8, 77.5; 50.1, 81.5|45.8, 59.1; 48.5, 64.3; 43.6, 62.6|28.9, 50.3; 31.9, 54.2; 33.5, 58.5|28.8, 38.6; 30.6, 30.5; 36.5, 29.5|43.5, 29.3; 45.8, 29.5; 46.2, 35.5; 43.2, 33.0	Metal, Elementium Ore, Giant Sack
				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.			
				Mined	Any minable mob	~	Deepholm	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	1	Most, but not all, minable mobs are found in Deepholm. Note that the ones you can realistically kill have a 5% or lower drop rate, so it seems unlikely farming Elementium would ever be worth doing this way. Take it as a lovely bonus on mobs you were already killing and mining.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Tol Barad	67.9, 53.2	Tol Barad Peninsula	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. Beware unpleasant members of the other faction. Can only be fished on the Peninsula, the northern contested area.			
				Fished	Sealed Crate: Darkmoon Island	~	Darkmoon Island	Fishing	FALSE	Phase 1	2	Fished from Shipwreck Debris. Contains primarily cloth and a smattering of other goodies. The Darkmoon Island's crates have a different drop table with more faire food. The pools can also contain mounts, so beware competition.			
			Folded Obsidium												
				Crafted	Folded Obsidium	~	~	Blacksmithing	FALSE	Phase 1	0	2 Obsidium Bar per Folded Obsidium. (Even though, really, it's twisted.)			Metal, Obsidium Bar
			Hardened Elementium Bar												
				Crafted	Hardened Elementium Bar	~	~	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Ten Elementium Bars and four Volatile Earth per Hardened bar.			Metal, Elementium Bar; Elemental, Volatile Earth
			Obsidium Bar												
				Crafted	Smelt Obsidium	~	~	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	0	2 Obsidium Ore per bar.			Metal, Obsidium Ore
			Obsidium Ore												
				Mined	Obsidium Deposit	~	Vashj'ir: Kelp'thar Forest; Vashj'ir: Shimmering Expanse; Vashj'ir: Abyssal Depths; Mount Hyjal; Deepholm	Mining	FALSE	Phase 1	3	Rich veins occasionally replace regular spawns in Deepholm only. If there were no competition, Deepholm would be best for farming. In practice however, you'll have to contend with countless druids. There is not really a better source, so you'll have to try for yourself and figure out what area works best for you. While Vashj'ir may look worthless, consider that you can unlock a seahorse mount with only a few quests that goes very fast even if you don't have master riding skill. This could put you on even footing if you can't afford to give your farming character fast flying.		38.3, 19.4; 37.5, 20.5; 35.2, 22.1|48.5, 19.5; 52.1, 22.7; 54.9, 27.5; 52.1, 25.5; 47.0, 27.0; 46.7, 23.9|48.7, 33.0; 51.6, 32.1; 51.6, 36.0; 49.8, 34.5|54.5, 44.1; 61.0, 45.5; 59.1, 46.9; 56.5, 46.2; 59.9, 55.5; 61.9, 57.5; 62.6, 59.5; 58.7, 60.0|49.8, 55.5; 53.7, 62.1; 51.2, 58.4|58.1, 73.6; 60.2, 78.9; 58.5, 80.0; 58.7, 85.2; 57.9, 87.9; 54.6, 84.2; 58.5, 80.0::40.2, 30.9;41.5, 30.8; 47.1, 33.7; 50.6, 34.5; 52.5, 35.9; 53.5, 37.8; 50.7, 36.3; 47.9, 37.5; 46.5, 43.7; 41.0, 40.7; 40.5, 39.5; 41.8, 37.5; 39.8, 32.5|52.5, 43.8; 56.2, 40.5; 56.9, 39.1; 59.9, 38.5; 65.1, 40.0; 61.0, 41.1; 56.8, 41.6; 52.2, 45.5|66.9, 52.2; 68.5, 51.9; 67.6, 54.8; 66.3, 54.5|59.7, 79.7; 61.9, 81.5; 62.1, 83.5; 60.5, 88.3; 57.1, 90.7; 54.6, 90.0; 49.7, 86.2; 47.6, 83.5; 53.3, 84.5; 55.0, 82.2|44.0, 66.5; 41.2, 76.1; 39.8, 80.5; 40.5, 76.5; 43.2, 67.0|36.7, 65.1; 36.5, 73.7; 35.6, 69.8::46.5, 24.6; 46.5, 28.5; 44.6, 31.5; 38.6, 38.3; 33.9, 36.6; 34.6, 32.9; 36.1, 29.3; 35.3, 25.5; 38.6, 26.2; 41.6, 29.8;44.6, 29.2|40.2, 21.2; 42.1, 18.1; 47.4, 17.1; 50.5, 17.7; 56.3, 22.6; 54.3, 33.1; 52.5, 28.9; 51.6, 24.0; 48.8, 18.6; 42.5, 21.8|48.8, 35.9; 51.9, 35.6; 48.5, 37.7; 45.8, 39.0|54.6, 43.5; 57.2, 45.5; 53.7, 46.7; 52.6, 45.6|49.8, 69.5; 50.9, 71.0; 52.0, 78.6; 49.0, 78.5; 48.2, 69.3|42.1, 74.7; 45.9, 56.1; 46.9, 45.5; 48.9, 48.8; 44.2, 72.7; 42.5, 78.5|25.2, 74.3; 28.6, 72.6; 33.1, 72.2; 34.5, 73.1; 33.7, 74.8; 32.0, 73.5; 25.5, 77.2|23.5, 49.2; 21.5, 53.2; 20.6, 50.7|22.0, 59.6, 21.1, 65.5; 20.5, 63.0; 20.9, 60.1::10.5, 34.5; 12.5, 32.1; 13.6, 31.6; 14.7, 38.8; 9.3, 36.5|12.9, 46.6; 17.2, 45.5; 17.6, 46.5; 15.5, 52.5|23.0, 31.5; 25.7, 29.8; 24.7, 32.2; 28.7, 35.7; 27.8, 38.6; 31.1, 40.4; 27.5, 41.0; 25.7, 40.6; 25.7, 38.5; 24.5, 35.7|17.9, 55.4; 21.5, 56.8; 25.6, 60.8; 23.3, 61.5; 19.2, 59.0; 18.0, 56.5|27.7, 51.2; 29.9, 50.9; 32.5, 46.0; 34.1, 46.8; 36.3, 44.0; 37.5, 50.8; 40.3, 51.6; 37.7, 55.0; 41.5, 58.8; 41.5, 63.3; 38.9, 65.5; 32.8, 66.6; 32.8, 61.8; 27.6, 55.0|32.9, 74.2; 32.5, 77.2; 31.5, 82.3; 33.9, 91.6; 36.6, 95.5; 35.8, 98.9; 32.2, 94.2; 31.3, 90.4; 31.5, 87.5; 30.6, 75.1|35.0, 21.7; 35.8, 24.5; 34.9, 27.5; 35.0, 35.6; 32.3, 28.8;32.4, 24.1|39.8, 29.7; 46.6, 35.6; 42.2, 33.9; 39.9, 32.5|41.2, 20.5; 47.5, 17.8; 50.5, 17.0; 48.2, 21.1|52.5, 17.7; 57.8, 14.5; 55.5, 18.3; 65.7, 18.5; 55.6, 19.8; 54.0, 20.8|44.9, 25.5; 49.6, 25.5; 53.0, 29.7; 56.5, 29.0; 56.3, 32.8; 54.8, 36.4; 53.0, 38.4; 51.6, 34.0; 49.1, 30.0; 42.9, 27.5|58.6, 32.4; 67.2, 29.1; 65.5, 32.5; 61.1, 36.7|47.7, 53.3; 49.6, 51.1; 51.9, 50.8; 54.6, 52.5; 56.3, 52.5; 59.7, 56.3; 62.7, 53.7; 64.5, 50.9; 67.5, 50.6; 69.8, 56.0; 68.0, 55.7; 64.5, 56.8; 62.8, 60.0; 60.0, 60.5; 58.6, 58.8; 52.3, 58.6; 51.0, 60.0; 49.7, 59.6|55.3, 64.9; 58.9, 66.5; 57.9, 68.1; 62.0, 72.1; 59.8, 73.0; 57.6, 72.1; 56.5, 69.8; 54.3, 68.5; 53.6, 66.8|59.6, 77.5; 60.6, 82.5; 59.0, 84.9; 59.2, 82.5; 56.7, 81.2; 56.8, 79.5|51.8, 75.1; 52.5, 77.6; 50.8, 82.1|72.9, 57.9; 74.7, 56.9; 76.8, 57.5; 78.5, 53.3; 80.6, 51.2; 82.5, 50.6; 84.2, 47.5; 88.1, 48.5; 86.5, 55.7; 84.5, 65.0; 80.2, 67.5; 78.1, 64.6; 75.9, 69.6; 75.2, 66.6; 72.7, 65.0; 73.1, 62.5::59.8, 32.5; 62.3, 30.3; 63.2, 22.1; 68.1, 23.8; 73.8, 28.8; 75.6, 36.5; 77.5, 46.5; 68.8, 48.8; 69.4, 56.0; 74.5, 60.3; 75.9, 63.9; 75.8, 67.5; 70.9, 65.3; 71.5, 75.9; 63.5, 84.5; 60.0, 84.5; 57.1, 88.9; 54.2, 84.6; 48.1, 88.5; 40.5, 88.5; 36.2, 83.5; 32.6, 84.4; 27.0, 77.5; 24.2, 68.8; 20.2, 57.0; 21.4, 46.5; 26.0, 41.3; 23.1, 35.3; 26.8, 30.6; 27.2, 27.3; 28.9, 22.0; 39.4, 13.2; 44.5, 11.1; 49.2, 14.0; 46.7, 19.5; 52.8, 20.5; 47.7, 27.1; 48.9, 33.0; 53.8, 34.1; 59.8, 32.5

				Container	Tiny Treasure Chest	~	Any	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	After using a Potion of Treasure Finding, drops from any Cataclysm mob that drops loot. The drop chance for a chest seems to be around 5% per kill. This is a decent source of cloth, while giving only trace amounts of ore and Volatiles. Thus, you should research whether the potion generates enough value to be worth its own cost, and use it when already farming something else.

While better than a mouthful of nails, you should try to avoid doing this transmute at all costs.

There are too many mobs to even list. It's a safe assumption that if you are slaying a humanoid which is moist, it'll drop a clam.			
			Chaos Orb

Some say this one will guide you to the Xel'naga if you collect enough!

You'd think it would be correctly spelled Dwarven Runestone, but you see, it's a stone that has the "dwarf" rune on it. Yep.			
			Essence of Destruction												
				Drop	Any Dragon Soul boss		~	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	As with any other raid material, you'll get this either for free or a very high price. Each boss seems to drop around 0.7 Essences on average. They will not drop them on LFR difficulty.			
			Highborne Scroll												
				Surveyed	Night Elf digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a night elf digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. You could probably just ask the artifact's original owner for guidance, since they're all still around, but that may be a bad idea with some highborne.			
			Living Ember												
				Drop	Any Firelands boss	22.2, 42.8	~	Group	FALSE	Phase 1	0	As with any other raid material, you'll get this either for free or a very high price. Each boss seems to have around a 33% chance of dropping one, very rarely dropping two.			
			Nerubian Obelisk												
				Surveyed	Nerubian digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a nerubian digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. Sadly, all that we thought to be nerubian culture (like the design of most Scourge buildings!) was actually Maldraxxus all along, so this is near worthless.			
			Orc Blood Text

There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. The sheer impracticality of writing in blood deserves its own dissertation, but hey, if it works.			
			Pyrium-Laced Crystalline Vial												
				Sold	Yasmin	17.9, 86.8	Uldum	~	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Tucked in a little valley, not part of any faction so she will not give you discounts for reputation nor for being a goblin, but you can get a discount for being part of a high level guild.	26.6, 7.2

			Tol'vir Hieroglyphic

There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. If you find one of these, congratulations, you are now 12 fragments closer to not getting that sandstone drake recipe.			
			Troll Tablet												
				Surveyed	Troll digsites	~	~	Archeology	FALSE	Phase 1	0	Random drop whenever you open a survey pile in a troll digsite. There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative. With trolls having spent ages as basically the only sentient species, you'd think anyone's back yard counts as a troll dig site, but nope, enjoy your travel.

There are no other original sources of keystones, but they can be traded and sold on the auction house, whether you want your archeology to go faster or to be more lucrative.
