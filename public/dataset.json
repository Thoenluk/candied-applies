It's certainly worth to fish these schools when you find them, but there are two issues: For one, since it is used in the good feast and does not drop from Gub's Catch for some reason, you can expect heavy competition. For two, the schools are linked with Deepsea Sagefish schools along the coast. You can try fishing those out if you can't find any Highland Guppy schools, but others will likely take them while you are at the coast. If there is competition, you may be better off simply fishing open water along the river or loch.",

In practice however, you'll have to contend with countless druids. There is not really a better source, so you'll have to try for yourself and figure out what area works best for you. While Vashj'ir may look worthless, consider that you can unlock a seahorse mount with only a few quests that goes very fast even if you don't have master riding skill. This could put you on even footing if you can't afford to give your farming character fast flying.",
